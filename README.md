# Embedded Software and Networking Small Projects
This repository features four networking projects I completed as a part of my independent research course at Duke University.

To see other assignments from this course, see the MITRE Embedded Capture the Flag Competition repository for the embedded software competition my team and I competed in, or PymedNetworking for python networking projects.
